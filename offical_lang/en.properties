TOWER_name=Basic Combat
TOWER_editorIntro=Good morning, Cadet. Glad to see you could join us.\n\nI am Commodore Schwarzkolm, and I am to be your instructor. Over the next few lessons, I will teach you what you need to know about airships. How they operate. How to command them. Their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nShall we begin?
TOWER_editorIntro2=The ship you can see below will be your first command, the HMS Lion.\n\n[c8b84f]Some basic information on how to navigate: you can move around using the arrow and WASD keys, or using right-drag. You can zoom in and out with the scroll wheel and the +- buttons.[]\n\nWe shall inspect each part of your ship.
TOWER_editorOutro=It is time for a simple combat situation.\n\n[c8b84f]When you are ready, click the Start button below.[]
TOWER_combatIntro=The HMS Lion can be seen at the left, and below and to the right is a small building full of separatists. The ship is already in position for its guns to fire, and vastly outmatches its opponent, so this should be an easy fight. You may simply... watch.
TOWER_victoryOutro=Excellent! We have smashed this separatist outpost. Let us continue to the next part of your training.
TOWER_defeatOutro=Unbelievable! The separatists have defeated us! LetQUOTEs try this again.

TOWER_SUSPENDIUM_CHAMBER=Your ship is composed of rectangular modules. The currently highlighted module is a Suspendium Chamber. The Suspendium crystal inside it generates lift for your ship, keeping it in the air. The chamber can be adjusted, allowing your ship to move up and down.\n\nThe effect of the Suspendium weakens at higher altitudes, which means your ship can only reach a certain maximum altitude, its service ceiling.
TOWER_PROPELLER=The propeller module produces propulsion for your ship, allowing it to move back and forth.
TOWER_COAL_STORE=Both Suspendium chambers and propellers require coal to function. This is stored here. Crew members automatically carry the coal to the modules that need it.
TOWER_CANNON=Of course, the HMS Lion wouldnQUOTEt be much of a warship without some weapons! These three cannon at the front of the ship will automatically fire at any ship inside their firing arc.
TOWER_AMMO=Ammunition is stored here. Again, your crew automatically takes care of reloading weapons. As a commander, your duty is to give high-level orders and position your ship effectively.
TOWER_QUARTERS=These crew quarters house the crew.\n\n[c8b84f]You can see in the info panel at the top left how many air sailors the ship needs and has.[]
TOWER_HATCH=This hatch is used to supply the ship with materiel. Depending on its size, a ship may need one or more hatches or cargo doors.
TOWER_BRIDGE=Finally, this is the bridge from which the HMS Lion is controlled. If the bridge is destroyed or left without crew, you will be unable to issue commands to the ship. But it will keep fighting!

TOWER_retryEditorIntro=
_Completed_=(Done)
ADD_GUNS_name=Cannon
ADD_GUNS_editorIntro=Your next command is the HMS Bear. Currently, it is unarmed. To complete this part of your training, install one or several cannon.
ADD_GUNS_editorOutro=[c8b84f]Click on the cannon in the panel on the left to select it. Then, click on the grid to place the weapon. The cannon needs to be connected to the ship and have free space in front of it. Ghostly floors extend from the ship where modules can be connected to it. If your shipQUOTEs modules are not fully connected, a warning will appear at the top right.\n\nOnce you have placed the weapons to your satisfaction, click Start to begin the fight.[]
ADD_GUNS_cannonUnreachable=One of your cannon is not reachable from the main body of the ship. If you look at the floors and ladders of the ship, you can see that there is no way to get to the cannon.\n\n[c8b84f]There is also a warning in the top right. Select "Remove module" from the panel on the left and click on the cannon in red to remove it.[]
ADD_GUNS_cannonDisconnect=One of your cannon is not connected to the main body of the ship.\n\n[c8b84f]It is highlighted in red and there is a warning in the top right. Right-click on the cannon or select "Remove module" from the panel on the left and click on the cannon to remove it.[]
c_moduleUnreachable=One of your modules is not reachable from the main body of the ship. If you look at the floors and ladders of the ship, you can see that there is no way to get to it.\n\n[c8b84f]Right-click on the module in red or select "Remove module" from the panel on the left and click on the module in red to remove it.[]
c_moduleUnreachable2=One of your modules is not reachable from the main body of the ship. If you look at the floors and ladders of the ship, you can see that there is no way to get to it.\n\n[c8b84f]Select "Remove module" from the panel on the left and click on the module in red to remove it.\n\nYou can also pick up modules by right-clicking on them.\n\nAlternatively, you can add corridors or other modules to complete a connection to the disconnected module.[]
ADD_GUNS_combatIntro=The HMS Bear has discovered another small separatist outpost. Right now, the enemy building is not within the firing arc of the shipQUOTEs guns, because itQUOTEs too far up. Move the ship down.\n\n[c8b84f]Select the Move command from the command panel below. An outline of your ship will appear at your cursor. Click to move the ship to the location of the outline.[]
ADD_GUNS_goDown=The HMS Bear is still too high up to hit the outpost.\n\n[c8b84f]Select the Move command and tell the ship to move further down, so that the enemy building is within the firing arc of its cannon.[]
ADD_GUNS_victoryOutro=Success! Your education is progressing well.
ADD_GUNS_defeatOutro=Unfortunately, you were defeated. LetQUOTEQUOTEs return to the drawing board.
ADD_GUNS_retryEditorIntro=This time, make sure to add enough cannon to the HMS Bear to defeat the separatists.
ADD_GUNS_FIRE_POINT=To improve the shipQUOTEs survivability, the Bear has a Fire Point. Two massive tanks of water used by the crew to fight any fires that spring up during combat.
FIRING_ARCS_name=Positioning
FIRING_ARCS_editorIntro=Next, we will learn about how to position your ship to avoid enemy fire. This is the HMS Leopard, your command for this exercise.
FIRING_ARCS_editorOutro=[c8b84f]Click Start to begin this combat exercise.[]
FIRING_ARCS_combatIntro=This time, we face a more serious threat, a republican defensive tower. A direct attack with the HMS Leopard would likely fail, but this tower has one weakness: nearly all of its guns face in one direction! To take advantage of this, you need to reposition your ship to be outside of the towerQUOTEs firing arcs.\n\n[c8b84f]Again select the Move command from the panel below. Click the "Flip" button or hit F to flip the outline of your ship then click above and behind the enemy tower to tell your ship to move there, with its guns facing to the left.[]
FIRING_ARCS_arcs=[c8b84f]The red firing arcs on your guns indicate that the gunners canQUOTEt bring their weapons to bear on any target. Use the Move tool to reposition your ship so that the enemy building is within the firing arcs of all of your weapons. Remember that you can move and zoom your view using the arrow keys, +- keys, and your mouse.[]
FIRING_ARCS_collision=Ships move in a more or less straight line towards their targets, but if they get too close to other objects, they stop to avoid collisions. Make sure there is free space between the ship and where you are telling it to go.
FIRING_ARCS_flip=You need to turn your ship to bring its guns to bear on the target.\n\n[c8b84f]Select the move command from the bottom panel and hit F or click flip to flip around the ship outline. Then, click on a location to the top right of the enemy tower.[]
FIRING_ARCS_goodPosition=Very good. Now make sure your cannon stay trained on your opponent, and wait until they are torn apart.
FIRING_ARCS_victoryOutro=Excellent! Using careful manoeuvring, you have defeated a more powerful enemy.
FIRING_ARCS_defeatOutro=Unfortunately, your attack failed. Try again, and make sure to position your ship correctly.
FIRING_ARCS_retryEditorIntro=
FIRING_ARCS_REPAIR_BAY=The Leopard has a repair bay, which contains tools and materials that allow the crew to partially repair damaged modules during a fight.
UPARMOUR_name=Armour
UPARMOUR_editorIntro=This is the HMS Tiger, a light warship. ItQUOTEs due to go up against an enemy installation armed with rifles, which are very effective against light armour. So before we go into battle, we must uparmour the HMS Tiger.\n\n[c8b84f]Beyond modules, there are additional layers to airship construction: armour, paint and decals. You can switch between those layers using the buttons on the panel at the left. The latter two layers are purely decorative. Right now, we want the Armour layer.\n\nSelect it now.[]
UPARMOUR_editorOutro=Right now, the Tiger is only protected by wooden walls so thin they could be broken with a well-placed punch. To survive the rifle bullets, the ship needs to have at least steel armour, or even reinforced wooden armour.\n\n[c8b84f]Select one of these armour types from the list on the left, then apply the new armour onto the ship by dragging the cursor over it.\n\nOnce you have completed uparmouring the ship, click Start.[]
UPARMOUR_combatIntro=Now letQUOTEs see if your newly installed armour is sufficient. This time, our opponent has rifles facing both directions, so there is a limited amount that we can do in terms of manoeuvring.\n\nHowever, we are currently quite far away from our target. Weapons become more accurate the shorter the range, and we are currently outside the effective range of the HMS TigerQUOTEs cannon. Move your ship closer to the enemy tower, navigating around the floating rocks.\n\n[c8b84f]The ship will fly in a reasonably straight line and automatically stop if its captain thinks itQUOTEs about to collide with a rock.[]
UPARMOUR_closer_yet=Move the HMS Tiger closer yet to make sure her cannon hit their mark.
UPARMOUR_victoryOutro=As you can see, the heavier armour is quite effective at protecting your ship. Of course, this comes at a price: thicker armour is more expensive and also heavier, reducing a shipQUOTEs service ceiling, the maximum height which it can reach.
UPARMOUR_defeatOutro=Evidently, yet stronger armour is needed.
UPARMOUR_retryEditorIntro=This time, letQUOTEs go for a full coat of reinforced wooden armour, which should be able to shrug off bullets with ease. We could use heavy steel armour, but this would be too heavy for the shipQUOTEs Suspendium chambers to lift.\n\n[c8b84f]Select the Armour layer from the left.[]
CHOOSE_YOUR_WEAPON_name=Weapons
CHOOSE_YOUR_WEAPON_editorIntro=Different weapons are best suited to different situations. Cannon can easily punch through armour but fire slowly. Rifles are cheap and can quickly take down less armoured targets. Grenades do a lot of damage but have limited range.
CHOOSE_YOUR_WEAPON_editorOutro=This is the HMS Porcupine, complete except for its armaments.[c8b84f]\n\nSelect the weapons of your choice from the panel on the left and attach them to the ship. Make sure that everything is connected properly, and that you donQUOTEt go over budget. As before, you can see any warning messages in the top right.\n\nOnce you have outfitted your ship to your satisfaction, click Start.[]
CHOOSE_YOUR_WEAPON_combatIntro=Now letQUOTEs see how your design does against this enemy warship.[c8b84f]\n\nRemember that you can use the Move command to reposition your ship to your advantage. Commands also have shortcuts that are indicated below the buttons. Note that once you have given your ship a command, there is a delay before you can give the next order.[]
CHOOSE_YOUR_WEAPON_victoryOutro=Victory! You are on your way to becoming a fully-fledged shipwright.
CHOOSE_YOUR_WEAPON_defeatOutro=Evidently, your design still needs some work. LetQUOTEs try again, and make sure to include enough armaments to bring down your opponent.
CHOOSE_YOUR_WEAPON_arcs=[c8b84f]The red firing arcs on your guns indicate that the gunners canQUOTEt bring their weapons to bear on any target. Use the Move tool to reposition your ship so that the enemy building is within the firing arcs of all of your weapons. Remember that you can move and zoom your view using the arrow keys, +- keys, and your mouse.[]
CHOOSE_YOUR_WEAPON_retryEditorIntro=
LANDSHIP_name=Landships
LANDSHIP_editorIntro=Landships are fairly similar to airships, but instead of being held aloft by Suspendium and moved by propellers, they are carried on tracks.
LANDSHIP_SMALL_TRACKS=These tracks carry the HMS Lancer. Compared to airships, landships are faster and sturdier, but less flexible. Larger tracks and robotic legs are also available.
LANDSHIP_editorOutro=As before, you may now choose the armament for your ship.\n\n[c8b84f]Two new modules have been added under the Weapons category:\n\nFlak cannon have an upwards-facing firing arc and require free space above them.\n\nDorsal Turrets have a wide field of fire, but require free space above and to both sides.\n\nOnce you have made your selection, click Start to begin the fight.[]
LANDSHIP_combatIntro=This time, your ship faces off against a high-altitude raider held aloft by tanks of Suspendium dust.
LANDSHIP_victoryOutro=Your design was successful!
LANDSHIP_defeatOutro=Unfortunately, the HMS Lancer was defeated by the enemy ship. Try arming the ship with flak cannon next time.
LANDSHIP_retryEditorIntro=
MULTISHIP_name=Multiple Ships
MULTISHIP_editorIntro=Next, I will teach you how to control fleets of multiple ships.
MULTISHIP_editorOutro=You will command a small fleet of three Leopard-class ships.
MULTISHIP_combatIntro=[c8b84f]Combat starts with the first ship selected. To select a different ship, click on it, or press TAB.[]\n\nPosition your ships to keep the enemy in their sights.\n\n[c8b84f]You can select multiple ships and give them orders at the same time. Drag to create a selection rectangle, or double-click on a ship to select all ships. You can also shift-click on ships to add or remove them.\n\nFinally, you can press ctrl and a number to store the current selection of ships, and the same number again to retrieve it. This lets you set up sub-squadrons for your fleet.[]
MULTISHIP_victoryOutro=You successfully commanded a small fleet. Nicely done.
MULTISHIP_defeatOutro=Unfortunately, your fleet was defeated. Try to make sure that all three ships are positioned to bring their weapons to bear on the enemy.
MULTISHIP_retryEditorIntro=Next, I will teach you how to control fleets of multiple ships.
DESIGN_name=Ship Design
DESIGN_editorIntro=This is the HMS Dragon. As before, it is complete except for its armaments.\n\n[c8b84f]This time, however, you are free to edit its design, adding and removing modules, and changing the armouring.\n\nYou have a budget of 1600. Keep track of your designQUOTEs status by looking at the information panel at the top left.\n\nOnce you are satisfied with your design, hit Start.[]
DESIGN_moreGuns=Make sure to add enough weapons to your design.
DESIGN_editorOutro=
DESIGN_combatIntro=This time, your design will face off against two enemies. LetQUOTEs see how it fares!
DESIGN_victoryOutro=Excellent! Your ship design has proved its effectiveness in combat.
DESIGN_defeatOutro=Unfortunately, your design was defeated. LetQUOTEs return to the ship editor and and apply the lessons we learned here.\n\n[c8b84f]Build a compact ship with a good balance of modules and plenty of weapons, and you will yet defeat your opponents.[]
DESIGN_retryEditorIntro=LetQUOTEs see if we can modify your design to win this fight. Or if you prefer, you can leave and restart this exercise to start with the original baseline design.
BOARDING_name=Boarding
BOARDING_editorIntro=ItQUOTEs time for you to create your first ship design from scratch. In particular, you are to create a troop carrier for boarding enemy ships.\n\n[c8b84f]Right at the bottom of the module list, there is a category called "Troops" containing the Marine Barracks module. Install two of those in your ship design.\n\nNormal weapons are not available for this exercise.[]
BOARDING_editorOutro=[c8b84f]You have a limited budget of 750. Include two Marine Barracks. Watch the warnings at the top right to fix any problems with your design.\n\nOnce itQUOTEs ready, click Start.[]
BOARDING_combatIntro=Your marines can now board the enemy ship.\n\n[c8b84f]To do so, first select the Board tool from the panel below and click on the enemy ship to select it as a boarding target.\n\nOnce your ship is ready for the next command, move it to be very close to and slightly above the enemy ship so that the marines can jump over.[]
BOARDING_victoryOutro=You have successfully captured the enemy ship. Captured ships can fight for your side if they have enough marines to man the guns.
BOARDING_defeatOutro=Unfortunately, your ship was defeated before it was able to capture the enemy. LetQUOTEs try this again.
BOARDING_nowMove=Now move your ship to be very close to and slightly above the enemy. Your marines will then jump over and begin taking over the enemy ship.
BOARDING_retryEditorIntro=
FINAL_TEST_name=Final Test
FINAL_TEST_editorIntro=ItQUOTEs time for your final test. A large enemy warship awaits you, and you must construct a ship to defeat it.\n\n[c8b84f]You have a budget of 2000, and more modules have been enabled for your use.[]
FINAL_TEST_editorOutro=
FINAL_TEST_combatIntro=Once you defeat this opponent, you will have proved yourself ready to design all kinds of ships and lead them into battle.\n\nGood luck!
FINAL_TEST_victoryOutro=Congratulations! You have passed the Airship Academy and are now ready to create and command aerial warships.\n\n[c8b84f]Next, try your hand at some custom battles, or start a campaign of conquest from the main menu.[]

sh_SPY_DONE=Your spy is now set up and reporting from {0}. The following information has become available: The income it produces and the size of its shipyard, which determines how quickly it can build new ships. Finally, the level of its secret police, which determines how susceptible it is to bribery and sabotage.\n\nIf you click on the city, you can now choose "View city", which lets you see its defences and garrison. Using spies, you can determine what kind of fleet you need to conquer a city.
sh_INVADE=Once your fleet is ready, select it. Cities your fleet can reach to invade now have an "Invade" button. Clicking Invade will send all selected ships.\n\nNow invade this city, and ready yourself for combat.
sh_INVADE_air=Once your fleet is ready, select it. Since the enemy cities are only reachable by air, you must then de-select any landships in the fleet by clicking on them in the list on the right.\n\nOnce you have done that, cities your fleet can reach to invade now have an "Invade" button. Invade this city, and ready yourself for combat.
sh_DEFEND=This city has no defensive buildings. To fix this, click on it and choose "Defences". This will open a screen where you can place buildings for construction.
sh_INVADERS=This enemy fleet is moving to invade one of your cities! Make sure it is well-defended. To strengthen it, move your fleets there, or build additional defensive buildings.
sh_RAIDERS=This enemy fleet is moving to raid one of your cities! If you are unable to quickly force the raiders to retreat, they will loot your city and reduce its income for a while. To prevent this, move your fleets there, or build additional defensive buildings.
sh_CONTINUE=Having made and consolidated your first conquest, you are now ready to continue expanding. Capture city after city, fortify your conquests, and build up your fleet.\n\nSoon, you will have united the world under your banner!

dragonNest_displayName=Dragons
dragonNest_occupation=Dragons have started nesting here!
dragonNest_description=A pair of dragons have made their home here. These half-mythical creatures are rumoured to hoard great riches in their nests, a boon to anyone strong enough to defeat them. A more concrete incentive for their removal is that the creatures are raiding the nearby countryside, carrying away people and livestock to devour, setting whole villages aflame.
x_defeats_dragonNest=The dragons were defeated by {0}!
dragonNestHoard=The rumours were true, at least in this case. In the smoldering remains of the nest, your troops find gold coins, giant jewels, old crowns, and enough silverware to equip a small castle. The proceeds make a fine addition to your treasury.
dragonNestRiders=In the wreckage of the dragonsQUOTE nest, your troops find a number of eggs, miraculously unharmed. They are transported back home and successfully hatched. The wurms that emerge bond with their keepers. With the right nutrition, they grow in size and gain wings, and eventually their keepers learn to ride them.
dragonNestDragonhide=Strewn about the ruined nest, your troops find the discarded hides of the dragons, shed in their yearly moultings. Fleet engineers devise a process for tanning the hides and layering them on top of wooden frames, creating pricy but resilient armour for the empireQUOTEs ships.
dragonNestDefeated=Your troops sift through the remains of the dragon nest. It turns out that the stories of dragon hoards were only half-right. There are plenty of shiny things to be found, but dragons have no human concept of value, and so most of the loot consists of copper pots and glass shards, with the occasional coin.
dragonNestAcid=Dissecting the grey dragonsQUOTE remains, your scientists make a number of useful discoveries about its acid spit. The few surviving grey wurms are kept alive and provide a steady supply of acid for a powerful new weapon.
dragonNest_upgrading=An especially large dragon has been spotted here!
dragonNest_upgradeDone=A huge dragon now roosts here.

SCHWARZKOLM_16=Aerial hussars and planes operate independently and return to the mothership to repair and rearm.
SCHWARZKOLM_17=If your shots fail to hit, consider switching your ship to aimed fire mode. Conversely, at point blank range, consider rapid fire mode.
SCHWARZKOLM_18=Once boarders take control of all command centers - bridges and cockpits - in a ship, they take control. The captured crew works to keep the ship running but will not man the guns.
SCHWARZKOLM_19=Boarding troops will attempt to jump, grapple or fly over to their target ship, enter through a door or hull breach, and take out weapons and command centers.
SCHWARZKOLM_20=Smaller weapons like rifles and gatling guns can shoot down boarders and planes that come into range.
SCHWARZKOLM_21=Very heavy ships suffer from a structural integrity penalty, reducing the hit points of all their modules.
SCHWARZKOLM_22=Ammo stores and most weapons can explode when damaged, and even set off chains of explosions when placed adjacent.
SCHWARZKOLM_23=Modules can be partially repaired during battle as long as theyQUOTEre not entirely destroyed. Armour canQUOTEt be repaired during battle.
SCHWARZKOLM_24=To effectively ram an enemy, choose the "Ram" command and pick a spot behind the enemy. Your ship will move to that spot heedless of any collisions.
SCHWARZKOLM_25=If your cities are beset by enemy spies, you can increase the funding for secret police in the Empire window. A strong secret police can be very costly for a large empire.
SCHWARZKOLM_26=The speed of a fleet is determined by its slowest member. If a selected fleet is fast enough you can click on an enemy fleet to intercept it.
SCHWARZKOLM_27=The crowQUOTEs nest, telescope, and targeting computer each increase the accuracy of all your weapons. Multiple such modules on the same ship confer no additional benefit.
SCHWARZKOLM_28=To move only part of a fleet, select it, then de-select any ships you donQUOTEt want to move.
SCHWARZKOLM_29=Crew pick up supplies from repair bays and machine shops and repair damage to modules, which consumes the supplies.
